`fakepushprovider` is a replacement for the push providers to be used in integration testing.

Project is in very early stage. Most of the functionality is missing and API breaking changes will happen.

Planned support for providers/transports:
- FCM(GCM)/HTTP
- FCM(GCM)/CCS (XMPP) - not implemented
- APNS/2 (HTTP/2)
